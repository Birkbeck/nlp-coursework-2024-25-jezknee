When is the Flesch Kincaid score *not* a valid, robust or reliable estimator of
 text difficulty? Give two conditions. (Text answer, 200 words maximum).

The score gives a very general answer to text difficulty, without knowledge of the reader’s own background. In circumstances where the reader has a high level of technical understanding, a difficult text may actually be far easier to comprehend.
The metric also doesn’t take into account how well-formed the sentences, just how long they are and how long the words are. Vague or misleading phrasing would increase the text’s difficulty, but wouldn’t be captured by the metric. Poor syntax or grammar would also be missed.
It also doesn’t measure how common a word is: a short, unusual word like “abb” or  “fa” would lower the Flesch-Kincaid score, but would reduce readability. Similarly, abbreviations would decrease the score, but the reader might not understand them.
In languages where words can be combined together to form new words, it might be easy to create simple words that are very long. For example, “Haustürschlüssel” (“front door key”) increases the Flesch-Kincaid score, but is easy to understand if you know the simple component parts.
